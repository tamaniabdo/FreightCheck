## Hi there 👋

I am a passionate programmer currently building my foundation I believe the best way to learn is by breaking things in the real world, so I focus on building complex, end-to-end applications to solve actual problems. I’m currently working on " FreightCheck "

FreightCheck automatically ingests shipping invoices, compares them to carrier quotes and shipment manifests, recalculates expected charges based on contract rules, and flags discrepancies for auditors to review and dispute.

What This Means

- Automatically ingests shipping invoices  
  The system accepts invoice files (PDF/CSV/EDI) from carriers.

- Compares them to carrier quotes and shipment manifests 
  It links invoice data with original shipment quotes and manifests (three-way match).

- Recalculates expected charges based on contract rules 
  It applies contract pricing logic (base rate, fuel surcharge, accessorials, dimensional weight).

- Flags discrepancies for auditors to review and dispute   
  It highlights mismatches and prepares evidence for dispute or payment hold.
